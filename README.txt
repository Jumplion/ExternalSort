T1, T2, T3, and T4.txt are the files that are utilized in this project. T1 is the main file that starts the sort, so put any data in there.

Sort.java is the "official" version of this assignment.

ExternalSort.java simply takes the information from the file, then sorts it.
ExSort.java was another attempt at this.
